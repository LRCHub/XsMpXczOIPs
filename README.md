[00:35.29] Turn your magic on
[00:37.77] Umi, she'd say
[00:40.31] Everything you want's a dream away
[00:44.23] And we are legends every day
[00:48.61] That's what she told him
[01:00.61] 
[00:52.61] Turn your magic on
[00:55.08] To me, she'd say
[00:57.60] Everything you want's a dream away
[01:01.55] Under this pressure, under this weight
[01:05.76] We are diamonds
[01:13.26] 
[01:07.45] Now I feel my heart beating
[01:11.55] I feel my heart underneath my skin
[01:15.49] And I feel my heart beating
[01:20.12] Oh, you make me feel
[01:23.82] Like I'm alive again
[01:33.82] 
[01:33.03] Alive again!
[01:37.38] Oh, you make me feel
[01:41.03] Like I'm alive again
[01:51.03] 
[01:44.10] Said, I can't go on
[01:46.32] Not in this way
[01:48.93] I'm a dream, I die by light of day
[01:52.88] Gonna hold up half the sky and say
[01:57.17] Only I own me
[02:03.67] 
[01:58.85] And I feel my heart beating
[02:02.99] I feel my heart underneath my skin
[02:06.83] Oh, I can feel my heart beating
[02:11.57] 'Cause you make me feel
[02:15.37] Like I'm alive again
[02:25.37] 
[02:24.45] Alive again
[02:28.83] Oh, you make me feel
[02:32.66] Like I'm alive again
[02:42.66] 
[02:44.34] Turn your magic on
[02:46.50] To me, she'd say
[02:49.06] Everything you want's a dream away
[02:52.87] Under this pressure, under this weight
[02:57.41] We are diamonds, taking shape
[03:01.78] We are diamonds, taking shape
[03:16.28] 
[03:20.55] If we've only got this life
[03:24.51] In this adventure, well, then I
[03:28.93] And if we've only got this life
[03:33.01] You get me through alive
[03:37.57] And if we've only got this life
[03:41.69] In this adventure, well, then I
[03:57.19] 
[03:45.99] Wanna share it with you
[03:48.89] With you
[03:51.02] With you
[03:52.83] I said, oh
[03:54.48] Say, oh
[03:57.98] 
[03:55.35] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[03:57.34] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[03:59.50] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:01.79] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:03.82] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:05.98] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:08.15] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:10.32] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:18.82] 
[04:12.41] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:14.42] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:16.69] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
[04:18.77] Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
